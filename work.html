<h2>WORK EXPERIENCE FROM 2021 - 2023</h2></font>

<p><font color="white" face="sans-serif" size="4px">I started my work life from 2021 after 2 months completing my Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM). I found that I have done all the things that I have been saving up during my study on SPM such as leisure reading novels, marathon watching Chinese dramas, Thai dramas, Korean dramas, and Japanese dramas, goinf to libraries, and sleeping as I sacrifice some of them to focus on my studies. Quit that, let's moving on to my work experience incase you want to know.</p></font>

<hr> <h1>THE FIRST HALF OF 2021</h1></hr>
<p>After finishing my Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM), I was interested in working any jobs that fits my qualification and I find a job as a salesgirl on a mall in the City of Johor. To be honest, I love this job very much as I was able to talk more to people and improve my interpersonal communication skills. I was once a very homebody and I am more comfortable and prefer to be by myself and this job embrace a new side of myself and I like that. Other than that, I have a very kind employer and workmates which I learned so much from them about the reality of bussiness industry. Not to mention, I received daily pay so after my hardwork everyday, I got instant rewards. ALhamdulliah. 
I do not have any photos from my working place as I failed to back up them after buying new phone. From this work, I bought a token which shows that I received my first ever paycheck as my mom told me to do so. So, I got a custom-made silver bracelet with my name designed on it.

<hr> <h1>THE SECOND HALF OF 2021</h1></hr>
<p>After another break of Covid-19, I work at my Mom's workplace as teacher assistant to my Mom whose a kindergarten teacher. This is a private kindergarten and day care that does not have so many students but they do accept special students that have autism and other disabilities. So, I was able to learn how to handle kids with that kind of condition.

<hr> <h1>THE YEAR OF 2022</h1></hr>
<p>On my semester break, it was too long which is 2 months because I have done final exam early. I reached for my boss from my first job but he still suffers from Covid-19 breakdown so I find other job. This time I found a bigger clothing stores that have franchises. I learned that bigger the company, the tougher the teamwork, so I learned how to prioritize teamwork. The job is the toughest eventhough I also a salesgirl, but this time we have a policy which we need to stand 12-hour with only 2 hour breaks. Sometimes, I was unexpectedly have to work overtime so 14-hours no sitting. I do have a leg injury so working in a very strict management like this caused me a leg as my leg condition got worse. Though, I still determined to keep my word to work there for 2 months but that also affected me. But here some fun memories:

<hr> <h1>THE YEAR OF 2023</h1></hr>
<p> I was assigned a task to do industrial training at Perbadanan Perpustakaan Awam Johor (PPAJ) together with my Classrep, Adibah as our home is at Johor Bahru, Johor. I learned so much about the real job of librarians especially from public library. I enjoyed the time there, it was so sad that it ended in 6 weeks, too short for me. But, the way that I need to write my internship report and do live presentation makes me rethink my decision, LOL :P Anyway, I was very grateful to learn this course though I am more interested in becoming a teacher like my Mom.
